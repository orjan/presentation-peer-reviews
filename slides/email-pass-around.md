##  Email pass-around

* Similar to the over-the-shoulder technique.
* Done after code has been checked in.
* All communication is done over email.
* Variations of this include GitHub PRs.

note:
	The email pass-around method is actually similar to over-the-shoulder, but instead of the developer explaining
	the code verbally, all communication is done via email. The only difference is that the code normally already
	is checked in. This technique has the pros that it's easy to implement, works with remote developers and that 
	it doesn't interupt the reviewers. The cons are that there is no real indication of when a review is complete
	or that even a review has taken place.
