## Obstacles

### Management
* Can we afford the extra time spent on reviews?
* Is this really needed?

### Within the team
* Feeling stressed out
* Yet another disturbance that will stop me from writing awesome sauce
* I'm a ninja developer, not casting for a part in the reboot of 1984

note:
    Friction from the management level shouldn't be a big issue since we're often responsible for a feature from story get prioritized until the delivery is accepted. Can we prove that reviews can help us to locate bugs and prevent them from hitting production it should be a problem.
    Friction from the Team can be harder to handle but since the are lots of different kind of reviews, they should at least try some of the out. Personally I find it hard with forced pairing but I'll love over the should reviews.
