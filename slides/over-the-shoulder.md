##  Over-the-shoulder

* One developer (reviewer) looks over the author's shoulder.
* Not to be confused with pair programming.

note:
	Usually the process is as following; the developer finds someone who can review his/her code.
	The developer walks the reviewer through the code and when the reviewer sees something that draws
	their attention, interupts with questions. The developer takes notes of the defects and proceeds
	to fix them after the code review.
