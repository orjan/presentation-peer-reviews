##  Pair programming

* Two programmers sitting together at a work station.
* Code is written by both developers taking turns.
* Two roles: The driver and the navigator.
* Proven effect on code correctness.

note:
	Pair programming is one kind of code review where two developers takes turn writing code.  
	The one writing code is called the driver, and the other person takes the role as the navigator.  
	Multiple studies have shown up to 85% increase in code correcteness depending on the driver's and navigator's experience.
