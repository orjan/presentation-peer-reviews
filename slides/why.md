## Why should we care

* Bug are expensive
* Knowledge sharing
* Maintainability
* Unclear features, is this what the customer needs?
* Communication Team/Client

note:
    As a developer I'm responsible for deliver stories as soon as possible.
    Minimize the frequency of bugs.
    The code should be maintainable.
    To succeed with these goals we'll need some guidelines and processes.
    Our stories are often unclear and we must communicate to be able to deliver.
