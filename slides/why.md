## Why should we care

* Early discovery of bugs are cheaper than bugs in production
* Knowledge sharing
* Maintainability 
* Communication Team/Client, is this what the client needs?

note:
    As a developer I'm responsible for deliver stories as soon as possible.
    Minimize the frequency of bugs.
    The code should be maintainable.
    To succeed with these goals we'll need some guidelines and processes.
    Our stories are often unclear and we must communicate to be able to deliver.
